                    Product Descriptions rainbow endeavors to be accurate when describing and displaying products on the Services. However, items may occasionally be mispriced, described inaccurately, or unavailable (for example, due to delays with respect

                    even the same or similar products. The particular technical specifications and settings of your computer and its display could affect the accuracy of its display of the colors of products offered on the Services. As a result, and as set
                    forth in the “Disclaimers” section below, rainbow does not and cannot guarantee the accuracy, reliability, currency or completeness of the information on the Services, including prices, product images, descriptions, specifications, and

                    agree to file such action only in the state and federal courts located in New York County, New York and waive any objection you may have to the venue or forum. Any controversy or claim between you and rainbow arising out of or relating
                    to these Terms and Conditions, or breach thereof, including disputes with respect to whether the subject matter of any controversy or claim is within the scope of the Terms and Conditions, will be resolved by binding arbitration in New
                    York County, New York under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) and administered by the AAA. The parties explicitly disclaim any applicability of the U.N. Convention on Contracts for the International
                    Sale of Goods to these Terms and Conditions. All arbitration proceedings will be conducted in English. Such arbitration will have one (1) neutral arbitrator if the amount in controversy is less than one million dollars (NT$‌30,214,200)
                    or otherwise before a panel of three (3) neutral arbitrators. Each of the arbitrators must be i) a lawyer licensed to practice law in the United States with a minimum of fifteen (15) years of legal practice or senior level business experience
                    or a retired judge with a minimum of five (5) years of service on the bench, ii) an individual with at least five (5) years of experience as an arbitrator, and iii) on the roster of neutrals of the AAA or similar nationally recognized

                    and you shall each select one person meeting the specified qualifications to act as neutral arbitrator, and the two thus selected shall select a third neutral arbitrator meeting the specified qualifications within fifteen (15) days of
                    their appointment. The third neutral arbitrator shall act as the chair of the arbitration panel. If the arbitrators selected by rainbow and you are unable to or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected
                    by the AAA. Neither you nor rainbow will participate in a class action or class-wide arbitration for any claims covered by these Terms and Conditions. Any dispute resolution proceeding will be conducted only on an individual basis and
                    not in a class, consolidated or representative action. IF FOR ANY REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, YOU WAIVE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT, CLAIM OR
